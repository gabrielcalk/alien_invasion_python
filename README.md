# alien_invasion_python

I used Pygame, a collection of fun, powerful Python modules that manage graphics, animation, and even sound, making it easier for you to build sophisticated games.

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.


### Installing Pygame
 ```
 python -m pip install --user pygame
 ```
This command tells Python to run the pip module and install the pygame package to the current user’s Python installation
